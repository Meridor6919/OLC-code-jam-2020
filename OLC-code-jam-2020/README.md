Description
========
This is "Not so great machine" created in c++ with DirectX11 from scratch during OLC2020 code jam.
I've planned to do something else but due to lack of time(procrastination) and skill I had to settle for simple arkanoid.
I' ve learned that creating something great requires a lot of hard work.

Controls
=======
Just right and left arrow keys to control the paddle.
